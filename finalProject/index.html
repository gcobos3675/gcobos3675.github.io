            <p>For homeowners that are moving into a new home either for the first time or last, we have a deal for you! If you contact us 
                to install a brand new security system to your new home, we'll add an indoor camera absolutely free!
            </p>
            <p>Indoor cameras can be great for homeowners that are always on the go and want to know what's going on inside their home at 
                any time. Whether it be to know if your children got home safe from school, or want to check on your pets to see what they're 
                up to when you're gone, the indoor camera is a perfect addition to any home security system. It even has a built-in speaker and 
                microphone so you can listen and talk to anyone in the same room as the camera without calling a single person. Call us for 
                more information!
