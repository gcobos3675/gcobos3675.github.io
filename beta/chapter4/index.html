        <h2>Creating a CSS File in VS Code</h2>

        <p>In VS Code, you first must create a new file next to your main "index.html" file and save it a "css" file.</p>

        <img>

        <p>Next, you now create style elements to design all the webpages that are under the CSS file.</p>

        <img>

        <h2>Linking an HTML Document to a CSS File</h2>

        <p>After creating the CSS file, you use a "link" element within the "head" tags. The Link element should include a "rel"
            and "href" attributes. The Rel attribute should have the "stylesheet" value next to it in order to link a style sheet to 
            the HTML document. The "href" attribute should have the CSS filename included next to it to let the HTML document know
            where the CSS file is located. Below is an example of the Link element:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"</b>
        </p>

        <img>
    </nav>

    <nav>
        <h2>Creating Style Rules</h2>

        <p>
            You then create style rules to indicate where logos, images, lists, and other elements will appear on the webpage.
            For example, you can use <b>list-style properties</b> on ordered/ unordered lists to change the design of the bullet 
            points or numbers. For example, by using the <b>list-style-type:</b> property on the CSS file, you can enter in "square"
            to have the bullet points appear as squares instead of circles, or enter in "upper-roman" to have a numbered list appear 
            as Roman Numerals.
