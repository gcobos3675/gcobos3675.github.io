                    <h2>Natalie Hayes (Woodstock, GA)</h2>
                    <p>"GNP Security made me feel safer in my home. Most companies that I have spoken to only offered me three door sensors and a motion 
                        detector with my alarm panel. GNP Security sent an inspector to my home to show me where I can place sensors, whether it be doors, 
                        windows, motions, glass break detectors, and smoke detectors. They even told me about adding a medical pendant, so I can send 
                        the ambulance to my home if I need to with a single press. I could not be happier with GNP security!"</p>

                    <h2>Richard Parker (Cumming, GA)</h2>
                    <p>"GNP Security saved my families' lives. I was out of town one night when my husband called me panicing. He fell asleep while waiting 
                        for our newly adopted son's baby bottle to heat up and it caught on fire! Our smoke alarms sounded off, but they were not connected 
                        to any system. Thankfully, GNP Security installed a smoke detecotor into our home that was connected to out panel, so when it 
                        detected the fire, the alarm went off, giving my husband time to grab our son and leave the house, GNP Security calling him and sending the 
                        fire department right away in a matter of seconds! If it wasn't for PNS Security, I don't know what could've happened. THANK YOU!"</p>

                <section class="events">
                    <h2>Angelica Gates (Atlanta, GA)</h2>
                    <p>"I recently moved into this new apartment in East Atlanta. Not even a week into moving in, my bedroom window was broken into, my 
                        jewlery and emergency savings stolen! After calling multiple security companies, I was about ready to give up, but thankfully, GNP
                        Security came knocking at my door. I explained to them what had happened and the immediately told me about window and glass break 
                        sensors that I can install in my bedroom, so if another crook breaks into my room, the police will be on the way. GNP Security 
                        helped me make a custom home security package, gave me a great price, and made an installation appointment all on the same day. With 
                        GNP Security, I can live, leave, and sleep in my house with peace of mind."</p>
