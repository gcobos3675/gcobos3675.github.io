        To plan a website, one must first understand the purpose of the website and know what the target 
        audience for the website is, since it definitely will not be for everybody. Next, one must design 
        the website to accommodate for varying types of devices that all vary from screen size, such as 
        monitors, smartphones, and tablets. Then, one must design a flowing and well-made wireframe and 
        site map to search through the website without feeling lost. Finally, one must find the right 
        balance of graphics, color, and typography to made the website feel comfortable and easy on the 
        eyes, as well as taking accessibility into consideration.

        In this chapter, I have learned that all HTML webpages include the basic HTML tags that
        are normally nine lines long.
