                In chapter 1, I had learned about planning a website and the steps that come with it. I didn't know that making a 
                website also had to be multiplatform for computers, smartphones, and tablets.

                I also had learned that the World Wide Web and the Internet are not the same. I had learned the Internet is a physical 
                network of computers, while the World Wide Web refers to information stored on the web.

                Lastly, I had learned about the different types of site maps. I didn't know that there were linear, heiarchial, 
                and webbed structures.
